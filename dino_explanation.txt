========================

The Three.js scene itself is from your tutorial video

Camera is simply adjusted on the negative z-axis.

The dino is utilizing the "group" feature where you can apply multiple meshes to one group to
perform a transmation matrix on all parts of the dino. 

You are able to access individual parts ( like the legs during the walk cycle ) to perform individual translations or rotations
The rest of the actions are utilizing a combination of javascript keyevents and translation and rotation of parts.
